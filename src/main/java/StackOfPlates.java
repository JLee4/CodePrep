public class StackOfPlates {
    /*
    Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple.
    Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold.
    Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and
    should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. Push and pop on SetOfStacks should behave
    identically as if SetOfStacks was only a single stack

    BONUS: Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs pop operation on specific sub-stack.
