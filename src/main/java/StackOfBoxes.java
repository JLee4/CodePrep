public class StackOfBoxes {
    /*
    You have a stack of n boxes, with widths w_i, heights h_i, and depths d_i. NOTE: w_i means w subscript i.
    The boxes cannot be rotated and can only be stacked on top of one another if each box in the stack is strictly
    larger than the box above in width, height, depth. Implement a method to compute the height of the tallest
    possible stack. The height of a stack is the sum of the heights of each box.
