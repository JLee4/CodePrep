# Code Prep

Java package to practice coding interview questions.
Data structures are provided but try not to use Java library structures as they could trivialize some problems.
Each question is contained in its own separate classes.
A unit test class is paired with each question and tests expected output.
A checkstyle test is included with the package and can be run with "./gradlew check" or "gradle check" in the command line.

Many of the questions in this package are taken and implemented from the books acknowledged below.
Please support the authors if you find this package useful.

## Getting Started

Only Java(8 and up) is necessary as you can run everything from the command line.
However, I recommend an IDE for ease of use.
Gradle should be installed to use "gradle check"
If not, the Gradle wrapper can be build automatically through an IDE and checkstyle can be run with "./gradlew check".

[Download the Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

[Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/)

## Tests

Pre-made tests are contained in src/test/java and are paired with each individual question.
Feel free to add more test cases as necessary.
